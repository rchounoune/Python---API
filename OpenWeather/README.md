## WeatherPy

In this project, I created a Python script to visualize the weather of 500+ cities across the world of varying distance from the equator. To accomplish this, I leveraged a [simple Python library](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/citipy) and the [OpenWeatherMap API](https://openweathermap.org/api).

The objective was to build a series of scatter plots to showcase the following relationships:

* Temperature (F) vs. Latitude

* Humidity (%) vs. Latitude
* Cloudiness (%) vs. Latitude
* Wind Speed (mph) vs. Latitude
